# String Compression

String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters.

EXAMPLE
Input: aaabbbcccdddAAaaCCC
Output: a3b3c3d3A2a2C3

Input: aabbccddAAaaCC
Output: aabbccddAAaaCC

The solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.
