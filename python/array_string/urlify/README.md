# URLify

Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20: You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.

EXAMPLE
Input: "Mr John Smith ", 13
Output: "Mr%20J ohn%20Smith"

The solution has a time complexity of O(logn) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.

## Run test
