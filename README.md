# Interview Questions

To get better at problem-solving, I signed up for a platform that gives different problems dailiy and they are actual programming interview question that tech companies have asked.

## Languages to be used

- Python
- Rust
- Go

I will further improve on my solutions by analysing the time complexity (Big - O Notation) and also the space complexity as much as I can.

I know my solutions can be further improved on but I will try my best to get a better solution considering time and space complexity

## Contributions and Sugggestions

I would love to read up on any suggestion you have based on my implementations of these problems, you can raise it as an issue or a Pull Request on the repository.
